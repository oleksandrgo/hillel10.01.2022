<p id="10">  <big>Someone comes to sleep on hands, someone does not allow themselves to be stroked, even when they are hungry. Each cat has its own character, but each of them requires special care. Cats are one of the most popular pets and require special attention and care. A cat is an ideal pet that does not need to be taken out for a walk. But this does not mean that cats require less attention than other pets.</big> </p>

<h2 id="1">Environment</h2>
<p> <img src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2017/07/20/02/03/cat-2520988__480.jpg" align="left" width="500" height="400">
The environment is very important for the health and well-being of the cat. A supportive environment allows the cat to safely socialize and get used to the people and things around her.

Even if the cat is still very small, it will organize his territory and mark his boundaries. In this territory, the animal will sleep, play, hunt, eat, hide, climb and communicate with people. The cat "divides" her space into four different zones, and you must respect her choice in order to avoid behavior problems, especially for cats who are permanently kept indoors.

Feeding area. It should be arranged in a quiet place, away from the tray and from the area where you yourself eat. It is better not to use the dining room or places where the animal can be disturbed for these purposes. In addition, the feeding area should be spacious enough.
Rest zone. This location will change during the day depending on the amount of sunlight and the location of the heat sources. By nature, cats prefer to sleep high up and must choose their own resting place, so make sure there are enough free areas in the house that your pet can enjoy.
Sanitary zone. The litter box should be installed in a quiet place that is always accessible to the cat, away from her food bowl and places of active movement of family members. Try to eliminate any sources of stress for your cat: for example, the animal may stop using the litter box if there is a washing machine next to it. It is recommended to provide at least one litter box for each cat, and to install one extra litter box so that each cat has a choice, this will avoid problems with cleanliness.
Game Zone. This is the largest area that serves as a resting place for the cat. It is very useful to install a play complex for cats in this area: this will encourage the cat's physical activity, maintain its health and well-being

<h2 id="2" >Physical activity</h2>
<p>
Cats that are kept indoors all the time need regular exercise to not only keep them fit but also stimulate their mental functions. This means that cats need the following.

Lots of toys (which can be hidden and replaced periodically to keep the cat interested), a place to climb and hide, and regular daily play with your family members.
Because indoor cats tend to lick their fur more and are sedentary, they need nutrition that will help them cope with the problem of hairball formation (this is especially important for long-haired breeds) and will take into account their low level of activity.
It is unlikely that you will like the scratches that a cat can leave on furniture or walls. However, this is a natural behavior for a cat, so it is important to provide her with special places where she can sharpen her claws. Install at least one scratching post in your home.

<h2 id="3" >Feeding</h2>
<p> <img src="https://www.kleo.ru/img/articles/oPmWR.jpg" align="right" width="500" height="300"> 
For indoor cats, effective food intake depends on several factors. Cats that are kept indoors all the time need regular exercise to not only keep them fit but also stimulate their mental functions.

Only high-quality food specially formulated for cats can guarantee that they receive all the nutrients they need to maintain health, regardless of their age, breed, lifestyle and health conditions.

While humans benefit from a varied diet, frequent and constant changes to a cat's diet negatively affect its digestion.
Food puzzles are a great way to develop your cat's intelligence and encourage her to forage and hunt on her own.
Hunting habits strongly influence cats' feeding behavior, so they tend to eat small meals several times a day, rather than eating the entire bowl in one or two meals a day.
Cats have a very high requirement for protein, including essential amino acids, one of which is taurine, found only in animal products.
Fats are an important source of energy for cats, who require more calories than the recommended calorie intake for humans.
Cats also have special needs for vitamins and minerals, such as vitamin D, which they can only get from food.
The digestive tract of a newborn kitten is well adapted to digest milk, as long as the milk meets the needs of the kittens. But as a cat ages, its digestive capabilities will change, and by the time a cat becomes an adult, its body will no longer be able to digest lactose.

<h2 id="4">Health</h2>
<p> <img src="https://giz.by/upload/iblock/709/709c5574337e16571be9c26b353bfd22.jpg" align="left" width="300" height="300"> The health and well-being of a cat depends on a number of factors, from preventive vaccinations and medications to health insurance and even spaying. All of this comes with some cost. Some of these costs are one-time costs, while others need to be considered as part of the current budget for the animal, along with the cost of food and grooming.

Cats are vaccinated against feline panleukopenia virus, feline herpesvirus, and feline calicivirus. The vaccination schedule includes two injections given 3-4 weeks apart. Your cat may have already had her first injection, as it is given starting at about nine weeks of age.
Microchipping is a painless procedure for installing a microchip that is implanted under the skin in the neck of the animal. In the future, information about the cat can be read from the microchip by any veterinarian or cat shelter employee using a portable scanner. This procedure can be performed during any scheduled visit to the veterinarian.
It is important to carry out preventive treatments against fleas, ticks and helminths. A good breeder starts antiparasitic treatment at an early age. Most shelters also have effective flea and worm prevention measures in place for all animals kept in the shelter. If you decide to get a kitten or cat, always ask if your new pet has been vaccinated and if antiparasitic treatments have been carried out.
Spaying or neutering is one of the biggest decisions in the life of any pet owner. Cats are usually spayed at any age over six months.
To prevent the development of diseases and to be able to monitor changes in the weight and behavior of your pet, it is important to take him to the veterinarian every year.</p>
<h2 id="5">Upbringing</h2>
<p>Much of a kitten's learning takes place during the first six months of life. Thanks to the dominant role of the mother and interaction with other kittens, the main part of the future behavior of the cat is laid in the first three months of life.

Accordingly, when a kitten is in your home, your opportunities to contribute to the basics of his education are limited, but you still have a number of obligations in raising the animal. Your task is to complete the education of your pet in the context of the new environment and eliminate his unwanted behavior.</p>
