<h3>What should you look for in a web browser?</h3>
 <p style="position: relative;left: 3%;width: 97%"><big> The best web browser should be fast and clean. You don’t want a browser that’s so bloated in features that it hogs your system’s resources and loads pages so slowly that you swear you’re on a dial-up connection.
<br><br>
And while speed is great, security should be a priority too. Internet browsers should protect you from trackers, hackers, and internet eavesdroppers.
<br><br>
Ultimately, a browser should be your interactive window looking out into the World Wide Web—a picture frame that should never distract you from the view at hand.
<br><br>
A web browser is not the same thing as a search engine, though the two are often confused.A search engine is a website that provides links to other websites. However, to connect to a website's server and display its web pages, a user must have a web browser installed</p></big>

<h3>Google Chrome</h3>
<img style="position: relative;width: 300px;height: 200px;left: 25%;" src="C:\Hillel\git_home_work\hillel10.01.2022\HM10\картинки\img4.jpg">

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome">Wikipedia</a>
 <p style="position: relative;left: 3%;width: 97%"><big> Google Chrome is a cross-platform web browser developed by Google. It was first released in 2008 for Microsoft Windows, built with free software components from Apple WebKit and Mozilla Firefox. It was later ported to Linux, macOS, iOS, and Android, where it is the default browser. The browser is also the main component of Chrome OS, where it serves as the platform for web applications.
<br><br>
Google Chrome is the fastest web browser you can get on a Windows machine. It surpassed the competition in three out of four tests, outranking even Microsoft’s latest Edge browser—which is now based on Chromium—in all but one test.
<br><br>
On Macs, Chrome is a heavy hitter in performance, outranking Safari in two out of four tests. It’s a good alternative to Safari, but Chrome’s data collection issues are a little disconcerting.1 If you’re worried about how Google uses your data, Safari or Microsoft Edge may be your better alternative.
<br><br>
Still, despite privacy concerns, Chrome is a great browser overall if you use Google’s services. It’s probably the ideal default browser if you shift between Windows, Android, and iOS.
<br><br>
Bottom line: Chrome is the fastest browser on Microsoft Windows and an excellent alternative to Safari on macOS in terms of speed. However, you agree to Google’s excessive data collection in exchange for that speed and convenience.</p></big>

<h3>Mozilla Firefox</h3>
<img style="position: relative;width: 300px;height: 200px;left: 25%;" src="C:\Hillel\git_home_work\hillel10.01.2022\HM10\картинки\img5.jpg">
<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox#cite_note-21">Wikipedia</a>
 <p style="position: relative;left: 3%;width: 97%"><big> Mozilla Firefox, or simply Firefox, is a free and open-source web browser developed by the Mozilla Foundation and its subsidiary, the Mozilla Corporation. Firefox uses the Gecko rendering engine to display web pages, which implements current and anticipated web standards. In 2017, Firefox began incorporating new technology under the code name Quantum to promote parallelism and a more intuitive user interface.
 <br><br> 
Mozilla’s Firefox browser isn’t known for speed. It fell into last place in most of our tests for Windows and macOS, and that’s okay. Firefox is more about security features than speed, which is ideal if you’re more concerned about blocking malware than loading pages quickly.
<br><br>
Firefox received a facelift in 2021. Mozilla redesigned the tabs, prompts, menus, and overall look, giving Firefox a new modern interface. Under the hood, Firefox strives to keep you safe online with tools like DNS-over-HTTPS, which encrypts browser requests versus sending the information in plaintext.
<br><br>
Bottom line: If you want the best internet browser that puts security first, not data collection, then Firefox is your best bet. However, it’s not the fastest browser available.</p></big>

<h3>Vivaldi</h3>
<img style="position: relative;width: 300px;height: 200px;left: 25%;" src="C:\Hillel\git_home_work\hillel10.01.2022\HM10\картинки\img6.jpg">
<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivaldi_(web_browser)">Wikipedia</a>
 <p style="position: relative;left: 3%;width: 97%"><big> Vivaldi is a freeware, cross-platform web browser developed by Vivaldi Technologies, a company founded by Tatsuki Tomita and Jon Stephenson von Tetzchner, who was the co-founder and CEO of Opera Software. Vivaldi was officially launched on April 6, 2016.
 <br><br> 
Vivaldi breathes new life into the tired, repetitive web browser design. Here you can customize the start page, create and use a custom theme, customize and move the menu, customize the toolbar, and so on. You can also assign browser commands to keyboard shortcuts, map commands to gestures, and assign quick commands to the Function keys.
<br><br> 
In terms of speed, it’s not the fastest browser on the planet—at least, not yet. It’s the youngest in the batch, so there’s room for improvement. It ranked fourth in all four tests we ran on Windows, while its performance jumped between third and last in the same tests on macOS.
<br><br> 
That said, Vivaldi is an excellent middle-ground browser in terms of performance.
<br><br> 
Bottom line: Vivaldi is great for customizing your browser experience, but it doesn’t match the speed of Chrome or Safari.</p></big>

<h3>Opera</h3>
<img style="position: relative;width: 300px;height: 200px;left: 25%;" src="C:\Hillel\git_home_work\hillel10.01.2022\HM10\картинки\img7.jpg">
<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera_(web_browser)">Wikipedia</a>
 <p style="position: relative;left: 3%;width: 97%"><big> Opera is a multi-platform web browser developed by its namesake company Opera. Opera is a Chromium-based browser. It distinguishes itself from other browsers through its user interface and other features.
<br><br>
Opera was initially released on 10 April 1995, making it one of the oldest desktop web browsers still actively developed today. It was commercial software for the first ten years and had its own proprietary layout engine, Presto. In 2013, Opera switched from the Presto engine to Chromium.
 <br><br> 
The Opera browser from Opera Software is great if you want built-in social network tools. The browser’s sidebar includes shortcuts to Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Instagram, and three others you can pin to the browser window. Opera also provides a built-in VPN component, so you can prevent third-party companies from tracking you across the internet.
<br><br> 
On our Windows PC, Opera kept its seat as the third-fastest browser in our tests, falling behind Chrome and Microsoft Edge. It experienced a similar performance level on macOS, falling behind Safari, Chrome, and Microsoft Edge in our four tests. Opera has a “battery saver” mode that reduces background activity and pauses animations, but we verified it was disabled before running our tests.
<br><br> 
Bottom line: Opera is a good web browser if you want a built-in VPN and social tools. It provides middle-ground performance in terms of speed.</p></big>

<h3>Safari</h3>
<img style="position: relative;width: 300px;height: 200px;left: 25%;" src="C:\Hillel\git_home_work\hillel10.01.2022\HM10\картинки\img8.jpg">
<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safari_(web_browser)">Wikipedia</a>
 <p style="position: relative;left: 3%;width: 97%"><big> 
<br><br>
Safari is a graphical web browser developed by Apple. It is primarily based on open-source software, and mainly WebKit. It succeeded Netscape Navigator, Cyberdog and Internet Explorer for Mac as the default web browser for Macintosh computers. It is supported on macOS, iOS, and iPadOS; a Windows version was offered from 2007 to 2010.
 <br><br> 
Safari is an excellent example of how Apple optimizes its software for Macs. It’s fast, simply designed, and somewhat customizable. It supports Chrome extensions, tab previews for power users, and easy translations using the menu bar. And while we will always recommend Firefox as the best browser for security, Safari does include a privacy report panel that displays all the websites that have tracked you across the internet.
<br><br> 
The drawback with Safari is that you can’t install it on anything but Apple devices. That means we could measure its performance only on macOS, so there are no numbers for Windows-based PCs. That said, Safari and Chrome duked it out for the fastest browser, both taking the top spots in two out of four tests. If you want speed, either browser will do.
<br><br> 
Bottom line: Safari is the best browser for Macs, hands down. Stick with Safari if you also have an iPhone or iPad. However, if you use other platforms like Windows and Android, Chrome is the better multiplatform solution—if you can ignore Chrome’s data collection woes.</p></big>

<h3>Microsoft Edge</h3>
<img style="position: relative;width: 300px;height: 200px;left: 25%;" src="C:\Hillel\git_home_work\hillel10.01.2022\HM10\картинки\img9.jpg">
<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Edge">Wikipedia</a>
 <p style="position: relative;left: 3%;width: 97%"><big> Microsoft Edge is a cross-platform web browser created and developed by Microsoft. It was first released for Windows 10 and Xbox One in 2015, for Android and iOS in 2017,for macOS in 2019, and for Linux in 2020, and can replace Internet Explorer on Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2 and later versions but unlike IE, this browser does not support Windows Vista or earlier versions.
<br><br>
The original Edge browser was a clunky mess despite Microsoft’s good intentions. It used the company’s in-house EdgeHTML engine and really couldn’t compete with Chrome. Microsoft scrapped its proprietary engine in early 2020 and chose Chromium instead, the browser foundation used in Chrome, Opera, Vivaldi, Brave, and more.
<br><br> 
Now Microsoft Edge is available on most platforms and is highly competitive in terms of speed. On Windows, it gave Chrome a run for its money, falling just a hair behind Google’s browser in three of four of our tests. On macOS, Chrome and Microsoft Edge were nearly identical in performance, both falling behind Safari.
 <br><br> 
Bottom line: Microsoft Edge is a great native browser for Windows and a good alternative to Safari on macOS if you need a browser that runs outside Apple’s ecosystem.
